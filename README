ShoRAH consists of several programs:

shorah.py    - runs the following programs
dec.py       - local error correction based on diri_sampler
diri_sampler - Gibbs sampling for Dirichlet process mixture
contain.cc   - eliminate redundant reads
mm.py        - maximum matching haplotype construction
freqEst.cc   - EM algorithm for haplotype frequency
fas2read.pl  - translates between two formats for read data files
bam2msa.py   - extracts a multiple sequence alignment from a BAM file
snv.py       - extracts SNVs from locally reconstructed windows
b2w.c        - creates windows from a bam alignment file
fil.c        - performs a strand bias test on predicted SNVs

GENERAL USAGE:
--------------------------------------------------

Install:
	From within the samtools directory, type 'make'. Then, from within
        shorah directory, type 'make' to build the C++ and C programs, then 
        run. See INSTALL for additional information.

Run:
	Type shorah.py -h for command line instructions. 
        If shorah is run within a directory in which it has already been 
        run, only SNV calling will be performed. This facilitates 
        experimenting with different values of sigma for the strand bias 
        test.

SHORAH.PY:
--------------------------------------------------

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -b B, --bam=B         sorted bam format alignment file.
  -f F, --fasta=F       reference genome in fasta format.
  -a A, --alpha=A       alpha in dpm sampling <0.01>
  -w W, --windowsize=W  window size <201>
  -s S, --winshifts=S   number of window shifts <3>
  -i I, --sigma=I       value of sigma to use when calling SNVs
  -x X, --maxcov=X      approximate maximum coverage allowed
  -r R, --region=R      region in format 'chr:start-stop', eg 'ch3:1000-3000'
  -k, --keep_files      keep intermediate files (Gibbs sampling)
